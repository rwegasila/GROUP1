            My  journey into the realm of databases began with a curiosity sparked during
              my second semester of first year . As  I  delved deeper into the subject matter, 
              and found myself captivated by the power of structured data and its applications
               across various domains. Whether it's designing relational databases, optimizing 
               query performance, or implementing data security measures,  I thrive on the
                challenges presented by this dynamic field.
